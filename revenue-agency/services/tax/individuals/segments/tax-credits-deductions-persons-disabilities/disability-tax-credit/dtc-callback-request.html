<div class="alert alert-danger">
<h2 class="h3">Callback service temporarily unavailable â€“ 2025-09-15</h2>
<p>As this is a pilot program, we have a limited capacity. We have reached the maximum number of callback requests for today.</p>
<p>The callback request form will be reactivated when the service becomes available</p>
</div>
-->
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is testing a new callback request service to provide more efficient and convenient support to Canadians.</p>
<p>At this time, the service is only available for certain Disability Tax Credit (DTC) enquiries.</p>
<p>Only the DTC topics listed in the form are eligible for a callback. Requests related to other topics cannot be addressed through this service.</p>
<p>This form is intended for individuals only. Tax professionals are not eligible to use the form.</p>
<p>Once you have submitted your request, you can expect to receive a callback within <span class="nowrap">2 business days</span>. Requests are processed in the order they are received.</p>
<p>Submitting multiple requests for the same issue will not make the process faster.</p>
<h2>Find your answers faster</h2>
<p>You may find your answers without requesting a callback and waiting.</p>
<h3>Sign in to your CRA account</h3>
<p>If you have a CRA account, you can view the status of your DTC application or reassessment in the Progress Tracker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html" class="btn btn-default">Sign in to your CRA account</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/register-cra-sign-in-services.html">Register for a CRA account</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/progress-tracker.html">Learn about Progress Tracker</a></p>
<h3>DTC application processing times</h3>
<p>If you recently applied for the DTC, it may take up to <span class="nowrap">15 weeks</span> to process your application.</p>
<h3>Reassessment processing times</h3>
<p>If your DTC application has been approved,&nbsp;and you requested adjustments to your previous tax returns,&nbsp;your tax return(s) will be reassessed. It may take up to <span class="nowrap">30 weeks</span> after your DTC application is processed.</p>
<p>Only request a callback if the total processing time of <span class="nowrap">45 weeks</span> has been exceeded.</p>
<h3>How to apply for the DTC</h3>
<p>You may find the answers you need about how to apply and other general DTC information by reviewing the DTC web pages.</p>
<p>These pages also contain information about eligibility criteria and how to claim the credit.</p>
