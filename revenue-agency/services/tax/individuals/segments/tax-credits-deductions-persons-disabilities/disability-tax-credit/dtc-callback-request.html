<div class="alert alert-danger">
<h2 class="h3">Callback service temporarily unavailable – 2025-09-15</h2>
<p>As this is a pilot program, we have a limited capacity. We have reached the maximum number of callback requests for today.</p>
<p>The callback request form will be reactivated when the service becomes available</p>
</div>
-->
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is testing a new callback request service to provide more efficient and convenient support to Canadians.</p>
<p>At this time, the service is only available for certain Disability Tax Credit (DTC) enquiries.</p>
<p>Only the DTC topics listed in the form are eligible for a callback. Requests related to other topics cannot be addressed through this service.</p>
<p>This form is intended for individuals only. Tax professionals are not eligible to use the form.</p>
<p>Once you have submitted your request, you can expect to receive a callback within <span class="nowrap">2 business days</span>. Requests are processed in the order they are received.</p>
<p>Submitting multiple requests for the same issue will not make the process faster.</p>
<h2>Before you request a callback</h2>
<p>You may find your answers without requesting a callback and waiting.</p>
<h3>Sign in to your CRA account</h3>
<p>If you have a CRA account, you can view the status of your DTC application or reassessment in the Progress Tracker.</p>
