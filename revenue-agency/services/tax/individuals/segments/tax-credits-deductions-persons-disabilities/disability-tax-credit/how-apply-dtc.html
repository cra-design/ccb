            <summary>Possible medical practitioner fees</summary>
            <p>If your medical practitioner charges a fee for completing the DTC application, you are responsible to pay it. However, you may be able to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/lines-33099-33199-eligible-medical-expenses-you-claim-on-your-tax-return.html">claim it as a medical expense</a> on your tax return.</p>
        </details>
        <h3>When to apply</h3>
        <p>You may apply for the DTC at any time during the year.</p>
        <p>However, if you submit your application at the same time that you file your tax return, there may be a delay in your tax assessment. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will review your DTC application before your tax return is assessed.</p>
        <p>To avoid a possible delay, submit your DTC application before you file your tax return.</p>
        <h3>Decide who is claiming the credit</h3>
        <p>If you intend to split or transfer the credit, it will save you time to include the supporting family member information in Part A question 2 of the DTC application.</p>
        <p>For more details see, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/segments/tax-credits-deductions-persons-disabilities/disability-tax-credit/claiming-dtc.html">Transferring the credit</a>.</p>
