</ul>
<h2 id="h-1">Who can claim the DTC</h2>
<p>The person with the impairment may claim the DTC on their income tax return once the CRA has approved the application.</p>
<p>If they do not need the full disability amount to reduce their income tax, they may transfer the remaining amount.</p>
<h3>If the CRA needs more information</h3>
<p>In some cases, the CRA may send a letter asking for additional information to confirm who is claiming the credit. The letter will contain a reference number and instructions on what to do.</p>
<h2 id="h-1-1">Transferring the credit</h2>
<p>If the person with the impairment does not need the entire disability amount to reduce their income tax, they may transfer some or all of the disability amount to the supporting family member who is identified on the DTC application form (Part&nbsp;A&nbsp;question&nbsp;2).</p>
<h3>Who qualifies as a supporting family member</h3>
<p>A supporting family member is someone who the person with the impairment depends on for at least 1 of the <strong>basic necessities of life</strong> (food, shelter, and clothing).</p>
<p>The family member must be <strong>1</strong> of the following:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li" aria-hidden="true"></span>their spouse or common-law partner</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li" aria-hidden="true"></span>their child or grandchild</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li" aria-hidden="true"></span>their parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, niece, or nephew</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li" aria-hidden="true"></span>a child or grandchild of their spouse or common-law partner</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li" aria-hidden="true"></span>a parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, niece, or nephew of their spouse or common-law partner</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to transfer the credit</h3>
<p>If the supporting family member who wants to claim the credit was not identified on the initial application, they can submit a written request to the CRA for the transfer. This request must be signed and include details of the support they provide for the basic necessities of life.</p>
<p>If the supporting family member was identified on the initial application, and it is approved, go to: <a href="#claim-dependant-transfer">Claim for a dependant or transfer the credit</a></p>
<h2 id="h-2">Claiming for the 2024 tax year</h2>
<p>Approved applicants who are 18 years and older (on the last day of the year) may claim the base disability amount. Those who are under 18 years old (on the last day of the year) may also claim the supplement for children with disabilities.</p>

<h3 id="h-2-1">How to claim the DTC on your tax return</h3>

</dl>
<h3 id="med-prac">Medical practitioner fees</h3>
<p>If the medical practitioner charged a fee for completing the DTC application or for providing information, you may be able to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/lines-33099-33199-eligible-medical-expenses-you-claim-on-your-tax-return.html">claim the fee as medical expense</a> on lines 33099 or 33199 of your tax return.</p>
<h3><span class="far fa-clock"></span>&nbsp;Tax return processing times</h3>
<p>Processing times vary according to how you file. Electronic filing is generally faster than paper filing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/check-cra-processing-times.html">Check CRA processing times</a></p>
<p>If you send your DTC application form at the same time as your tax return, the CRA will review your application before they assess your tax return. This may cause delays in the assessment of your tax return.</p>
<h2 id="h-3">Claiming for past years</h2>
<p>If you were eligible for the DTC in past years but did not claim the disability amount, you may be able to claim it going back up to <strong>10&nbsp;years</strong>.</p>
<p>If you did <strong>not</strong> check the box on the DTC application form asking the CRA to adjust your previous returns, you may either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ask the CRA in writing to adjust your previous return(s)</li>
    <li>adjust your previous return(s) yourself online<br /><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/change-your-return.html">How to change a return</a></li>
