<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">What is the DTC</h1>
<h2 id="h-1">DTC is a non-refundable tax credit</h2>
<p>The DTC helps reduce the income tax that people with physical or mental impairments, or their supporting family members, may have to pay. It aims to offset some of the costs related to the impairment.</p>
<p>If the DTC total is more than the amount an individual owes on their taxes, the CRA will not refund the remaining amount of the credit.</p>
<h3 id="h-2">Apply first, then claim</h3>
<p>There are 2 main steps to getting the DTC:</p>
<ol class="lst-stps">
    <li>
        <h4>Applying for the credit</h4>
        <p>This involves you and a medical practitioner who can certify the effects of your impairment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Claiming the credit on your tax return</h4>
        <p>If your application is approved, you may then claim the disability amount on your tax return.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Related benefits and programs</h3>
<p>If you think you may be eligible for the DTC, you should apply. Being eligible for the DTC may help you access other federal programs such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-disability-savings-plan-rdsp.html">registered disability savings plan</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-workers-benefit.html">Canada workers benefit disability supplement</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-disability-benefit.html">child disability benefit</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/disability/canada-disability-benefit.html">Canada disability benefit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, being eligible for other federal or provincial disability programs does not affect eligibility for the DTC.</p>
