        <p>You may be eligible for the DTC if a medical practitioner certifies that you have a severe and prolonged impairment in 1 of the categories, significant limitations in 2 or more categories, or receive therapy to support a vital function.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You are unable to do the activity, or it takes 3 times longer than someone of similar age without the impairment, even with the use of appropriate therapy, medication, and devices</li>
                <li>This restriction is present all or almost all of the time (generally at least 90%)</li>
                <li>The restriction has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months</li>
