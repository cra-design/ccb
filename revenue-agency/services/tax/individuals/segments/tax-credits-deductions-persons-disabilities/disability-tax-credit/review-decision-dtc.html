<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>The Canada Revenue Agency is experiencing delays in processing Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate. The most up to date processing times can be found on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/check-cra-processing-times.html">Check CRA processing times</a>. We will respond in writing once a decision has been made. You can also view&nbsp;the status of your application through the progress tracker in your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="h-1">CRA's review of your application</h2>
<p>After your application for the DTC is received, the CRA assesses it to determine if you are eligible. CRA's decision is based on the information given by the medical practitioner.</p>
<h3>How long it will take</h3>
<p>The CRA aims to process your application and send you a notice of determination in a timely manner. It may take longer if information is missing. To view the status of your application, sign up for a CRA account and use the progress tracker OR <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/check-cra-processing-times.html">Check CRA processing times</a>&nbsp;to see average processing times.</p>
<p>If you send your application with your tax return, the CRA will review your application before assessing your income tax return.</p>
<h4>Check the status of your application:</h4>
<p>You can view the status of your application using the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/progress-tracker.html">progress tracker</a> in My Account.</p>
<p>We will respond in writing once a decision has been made.</p>
<h3>If the CRA needs more information</h3>
<p>In some cases, the CRA may send the medical practitioner a letter asking for more information, such as documents to support your application. The letter will contain a reference number and instructions on what to do.</p>
<h2 id="h-3">CRA's decision about your application</h2>
<p>The CRA will send you a notice of determination by mail to inform you of the decision.</p>
<h3>If your application is approved</h3>
<p>If your notice of determination says your application is approved, you may claim the DTC on your income tax return.</p>
<p>Your notice of determination will show which year(s) you are eligible for the DTC. You don't need to re-apply every year unless the CRA asks you to submit a new application.</p>
<p>Being eligible for the DTC may help you access other federal programs <span class="nowrap">such as:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-disability-savings-plan-rdsp.html">Registered disability savings plan</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-workers-benefit.html">Canada workers benefit disability supplement</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/ccb/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-disability-benefit.html">Child disability benefit</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/disability/canada-disability-benefit.html">Canada disability benefit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some approved DTC applications expire after a certain number of years and you will have to re-apply. When your eligibility is about to expire, the CRA will notify you <span class="nowrap">1 year</span> in advance, as well as in the year it expires.</p>
<p>You can view your DTC information in CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>.</p>
<p>You must inform the CRA in writing if your medical condition improves to the point that you no longer meet the criteria for the DTC.</p>
<h3>If your application is denied</h3>
<p>If your DTC application is denied, your notice of determination will explain why.</p>
<p>Check your copy of your application, Form T2201, <em>Disability Tax Credit Certificate</em>, against the reason(s) given. The CRA's decision is based on the information given by the medical practitioner.</p>
<p>If you are not eligible for the DTC, other tax deductions and credits may still be available to you.</p>
