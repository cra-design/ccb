        <p>The disability tax credit (DTC) is a non-refundable tax credit that helps people with disabilities, or their supporting family member, reduce the amount of income tax they may have to pay.</p>
        <p>If you have a severe and prolonged impairment, you may apply for the credit. If you are approved, you may claim the credit at tax time.</p>
        <p>By reducing the amount of income tax you may have to pay, the DTC aims to offset some of the extra costs related to the impairment.</p>
