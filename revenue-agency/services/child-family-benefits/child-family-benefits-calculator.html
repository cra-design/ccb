    <p>On March&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2025, the Government of Canada <a href="https://canadagazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2025/2025-03-15-x2/pdf/g2-159x2.pdf">announced</a> that it will be removing the fuel charge from Canadaâ€™s carbon pollution pricing system and sunset the Canada Carbon Rebate (CCR) for individuals.</p>
    <p>The final CCR payment for individuals will be issued starting April&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2025. Please note, to receive the payment starting April&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2025, individuals must have filed their 2024 income tax and benefit return electronically no later than April&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2025. Eligible individuals filing their return after April&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2025, should receive their final CCR payment once their 2024 return is assessed.</p>
