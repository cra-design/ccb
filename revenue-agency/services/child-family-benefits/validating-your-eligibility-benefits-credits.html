    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>To confirm that the CRA has the most up-to-date information for you, we may send you a questionnaire or a letter asking for documents. This is to make sure that you get the right amount of benefits and credits.</p>
    <p>It's important that you reply and provide all the information requested by the CRA. You won't stop receiving your benefits while we review your information. However, if you donâ€™t reply, your child and family benefits may stop, and you may have to repay benefits that were previously sent to you.</p>
    <p>If you are having any of the following problems, call the telephone number below or the number provided on your letter:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>need a copy of the questionnaire or letter</li>
        <li>are having trouble getting the documents that we requested</li>
        <li>need more time to get your documents</li>
