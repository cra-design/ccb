<p>The Automated Benefits Application is an easy way to apply for child and family benefits when you register the birth of your newborn with your province/territory. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>After your baby is born:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Complete the birth registration for your newborn.</li>
    <li>Apply for Canada child benefits within the birth registration and give your consent to allow your province/territory to securely share the information with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</li>
    <li>Enter your Social Insurance Number.</li>
    <li>Submit your registration/application to your province/territory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your province/territory's Vital Statistics will send your child's birth registration information, including proof of birth, securely to the CRA. The CRA will determine if you are eligible for benefits and send you a notice or a payment within 8 weeks.</p>

    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>If you do not give your consent, the information on the birth registration form will not be sent to the CRA. You will have to apply for child and family benefits by using either the “Apply for child benefits” option in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>, or by completing Form RC66, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc66.html">Canada Child Benefits Application</a>. You will also need to provide <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/supporting-documents.html#h_5">proof of birth</a> for the child.</p>
        <p>If you do not provide your SIN, it may result in a delay in processing your application or issuing payments. The CRA may contact you if more information is needed.</p>
        <p>If you do not have a Social Insurance Number, you can obtain one by applying with Employment and Social Development Canada to one of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">in person</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">by mail</a></li>
            <li>by completing the <a href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=NAS2120">SIN application form</a></li>
        </ul>

<h2>Direct Deposit</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of using this service, the CRA recommends that you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">sign up for direct deposit</a> <strong>prior to giving birth to your child</strong> in order to reduce delays in receiving your payments. Submitting a direct deposit application would allow the CRA to deposit your payments directly into an account at your financial institution. If you already receive your benefit payments for your other children by direct deposit, you do not have to apply again. You will receive the benefit payments for your newborn in the same bank account.</p>
