<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">How much you can get </h1>
<h2>How much you can expect to receive</h2>
<p>Your GST/HST credit payments are based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4210/gst-hst-credit.html#toc0">adjusted net income</a><ul>
<li>If you have a spouse or common-law partner, your adjusted net incomes are combined to get your adjusted family net income&nbsp;(AFNI)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>your marital status</li>
<li>the number of children under 19 years old that you have registered for the Canada child benefit and the GST/HST credit</li>
</ul>
<p>For the 2024 base year (payment period from July 2025 to June 2026), you could get up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>$533 if you are a single individual</li>
<li>$698 if you are married or have a <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partner</li>
<li>$184 for each child under the age of 19</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/ccb/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/keep-your-information-date.html">keep your personal information updated</a> to avoid underpayments or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/balance-owing-benefits-overpayment.html">overpayments</a>. An increase of your 2024 adjusted family net income could affect your payments starting in July 2025. Go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/goods-services-tax-harmonized-sales-tax-gst-hst-credit/family-income-level-where-recipient-will-no-longer-receive-gst-hst-credit.html">GST/HST credit income levels</a> and the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/goods-services-tax-harmonized-sales-tax-gst-hst-credit/goods-services-tax-harmonised-sales-tax-credit-payments-chart.html">GST/HST credit payments chart</a> to find out if you are entitled to receive the GST/HST credit for the 2024 base year. You can also use the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html">child and family benefits calculator</a> to get an estimate of your GST/HST credit.</p>
<h2>What can affect your payment amount</h2>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency could recalculate your GST/HST credit payment when:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reassessment of either your or your spouse or <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partner's tax return results in a change to your adjusted family net income</li>
<li>your eligible child turns 19 years of age</li>
<li>your marital status changes</li>
<li>the number of eligible children in your care changes</li>
<li>a recipient dies</li>
<li>you start, or stop, sharing custody of a child</li>
</ul>
