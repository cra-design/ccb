<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">How much you can get</h1>

<p>The GST/HST credit payments are not taxable and credit amounts will vary based on your situation. You do not have to report the GST/HST payments you receive on your tax return.</p>

<h2 class="h3 mrgn-tp-md">On this page</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#toc1">How your GST/HST credit is calculated</a></li>
  <li><a href="#toc2">Estimate your credit amount</a></li>
  <li><a href="#toc3">Where to find your credit amount</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc1">How your GST/HST credit is calculated</h2>
<p>Your GST/HST credit payments are based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" aria-controls="centred-popup-modal" href="#afni" role="button">adjusted family net income<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a></li>
<li>Your marital status</li>
<li>The number of elgible children under 19 years old that you have registered for the Canada child benefit and the GST/HST credit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payment amounts are recalculated every July</h3>
<p>Your GST/HST credit amount is recalculated every July based on the information from your previous year's tax return. Each GST/HST credit payment period starts in July and ends in June of the following year.</p>

<p>For example, the information from your 2024 tax return determines the GST/HST credit amount you get for the payment period from July 2025 to June 2026.  You could get up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>$533 if you are a single individual</li>
<li>$698 if you are married or have a <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partner</li>
<li>$184 for each child under the age of 19</li>
</ul>

<p>An increase of your 2024 adjusted family net income could affect your payments starting in July 2025.</p>

<p>Find out the GST/HST credit amount you may be entitled to: GST/HST credit payments chart</p>

<h3>What affects your payment calculation</h3>

<p>The Canada Revenue Agency recalculates your GST/HST credit payment when:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reassessment of either your or your spouse or <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partner's tax return results in a change to your adjusted family net income</li>
<li>Your eligible child turns 19 years of age</li>
<li>Your marital status changes</li>
<li>The number of eligible children in your care changes</li>
<li>A recipient dies</li>
<li>You start, or stop, sharing custody of a child</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/keep-your-information-date.html">keep your personal information up to date</a> to avoid any disruption to your payments.</p>

<h2 id="toc2">Estimate your credit amount</h2>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html">child and family benefits calculator</a> to find out how much your GST/HST credit payments may be, and which other benefits and credits you can get.</p>

<h2 id="toc3">Where to find your credit amount</h2>
<p>The CRA will send you a GST/HST credit notice based on the information from your assessed tax return. The notice provides your annual entitlement along with the payment schedule for your quarterly payments.</p>

<p>If you do not have a CRA account, the CRA will send your notice by mail.</p>
