<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">How to get the credit</h1>

<p>In most cases, you do not need to apply to get the GST/HST credit. Your eligibility is determined when the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) assesses your tax return each year.</p>

<p>If you are a new resident of Canada, you only need to apply for the year you became a resident.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#toc1">File your tax return to get the credit</a></li>
  <li><a href="#toc2">Apply if you are a new resident of Canada</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc1">File your tax return to get the credit</h2> 

<p>You do <strong>not</strong> need to apply to receive the GST/HST credit. All you have to do is file your tax return every year, even if you do not have any income to report.</p>

<p>The CRA automatically checks your eligibility when your tax return is assessed each year. If you are eligible, you will receive the credit.</p>

<h3>If you file your taxes late</h3>

<p>You must file your tax return by <strong>April 30 each year</strong> to ensure there is no disruption to your quarterly payments. The GST/HST credit is recalculated every July based on your adjusted family net income from the previous year.</p>

<p>If you file your taxes late, your payments may stop temporarily. Your payments may resume after your tax return is assessed. Any entitled credit amounts that were missed will be paid as a lump sum with the next quarterly payment.</p>

<h2 id="toc2">Apply if you are a new resident of Canada</h2>

<p>The CRA considers you to be a new resident for the <strong>first year</strong> you are a resident of Canada for income tax purposes. You <strong>do not</strong> need to file your first tax return before you can get the GST/HST credit.</p>
<p>You must provide proof of birth of all children you are applying for when you complete your application for the credit. If you are providing original documents in a language other than English or French, you need to include an acceptable translation with a copy of the original.</p>
<p>Only <strong>one</strong> application per household is required.</p>
