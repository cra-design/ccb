<p>You are <strong>generally eligible</strong> for the GST/HST credit if you are:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span><p>At least 19 years old</p>
<p>If you are under 19 years old, you must meet at least <strong>one </strong>of the following conditions during the same period:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have (or had) a spouse or common-law partner</li>
<li>you are (or were) a parent and live (or lived) with your child</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span><p>A resident of Canada for tax purposes during:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col-80"><p>The month <strong>before</strong> the CRA makes a payment</p>
</li>
<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>At the <strong>beginning</strong> of the month the CRA makes a payment</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CRA normally makes GST/HST credit payments in July, October, January, and April.</p>

        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>Marceline turned 19 years old in September and became a resident that month. She applied for the GST/HST credit when she arrived to Canada. Now in October, Marceline wants to know if she is eligible to get a payment for the month.</p>
<p>Because Marceline turned 19 in September and was a resident in that month, if she is still a Canadian resident at the beginning of October, she will be eligible to receive a payment for the month.</p>
