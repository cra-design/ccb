<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">Payment dates</h1>

<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) sends your GST/HST credit amount as quarterly payments each year.</p>

<h2 class="h3 mrgn-tp-md">On this page</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#toc1">Payment dates for 2025</a></li>
  <li><a href="#toc2">If you turn 19 during the year</a></li>
  <li><a href="#toc3">Check the status of your payment</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc1">Payment dates for 2025</h2>
<p>You will receive your GST/HST credit payments 4 times in a year.</p>

<p>The payment dates for 2025 are:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="far fa-calendar-alt fa-li text-muted"></span> January 3, 2025</li>
  <li><span class="far fa-calendar-alt fa-li text-muted"></span> April 4, 2025</li>
  <li><span class="far fa-calendar-alt fa-li text-muted"></span> July 4, 2025</span></li>
  <li><span class="far fa-calendar-alt fa-li text-muted"></span> October 3, 2025</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc2">If you turn 19 during the year</h2>
<p>To ensure you start receiving the GST/HST credit soon after you turn 19 years old, you must file your tax return for the previous year. File your tax return, even if you do not have any income to report. The CRA will automatically determine your eligibility based on the information from your previous year's tax return.</p>

<p>If you are eligible and have filed your taxes, the CRA will issue your first payment on the payment date that comes after your 19th birthday.</p>

<h3>If you file your taxes after July</h3>
<p>The GST/HST credit is recalculated <strong>every</strong> July based on your tax information from the previous year. If you file your taxes after July, you must wait until the CRA has assessed your tax return before you start receiving payments.</p>

<p>Any missed payments you would have received, will be paid as a lump sum with the next scheduled quarterly payment.</p>

<h2 id="toc3">Check the status of your payment</h2>
<p>If you want to receive email notifications about upcoming benefit payments, you can sign up to receive <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/payment-dates-reminder.html">benefit and credit payment reminders</a>. The reminders are sent about one week before the payment is issued.</p>

<div data-ajax-replace="https://cra-design.github.io/ccb/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/gst-hst-credit/how-much.html#cra-account" class="original">

<h3>If you have not received your payment</h3>
<p>You will not receive quarterly payments if the amount per quarter is less than $50. Instead you will receive the entire amount as a single payment in July.</p>

<p>If you do not receive your GST/HST credit payment on the expected payment date, before you contact us, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sign in to your CRA account to check the status of your payment</li>
  <li>Make sure your information with the CRA is up to date</li>
  <li>Check other <a href="#">reasons for stopped or changed payments</a></li>
</ul>  

<p>If you still don't know why you haven't received your payment, wait <strong>10 business days</strong> after your expected payment date before calling us.</p>
