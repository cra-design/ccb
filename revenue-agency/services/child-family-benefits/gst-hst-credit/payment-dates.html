<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">Payment dates</h1>

<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) sends your GST/HST credit amount as quarterly payments each year.</p>

<h2 class="h3 mrgn-tp-md">On this page</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#toc1">Dates for payments made in 2025</a></li>
  <li><a href="#toc2">If you turn 19 during the year</a></li>
  <li><a href="#toc3">Check the status of your payment</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc1"><span class="far fa-calendar-alt"></span> Dates for payments made in 2025</h2>
<p>You will receive your GST/HST credit payments 4 times in a year.</p>

<p>The payment dates in 2025 are:</p>
<ul">
  <li>January 3, 2025</li>
  <li>April 4, 2025</li>
  <li>July 4, 2025</li>
  <li>October 3, 2025</li>
</ul>

<p>The GST/HST credit payment period begins in July and ends in June of the following year:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>January and April payments</dt>
  <dd>Based on your adjusted family net income from your <strong>2023</strong> tax return.</dd>

  <dt>July and October payments</dt>
    <dd>Based on your adjusted family net income from your <strong>2024</strong> tax return.
</dd>
  
</dl>

<h2 id="toc2">If you turn 19 during the year</h2>
<p>To ensure you start receiving the GST/HST credit soon after you turn 19 years old, you must file your tax return for the previous year. File your tax return, even if you do not have any income to report. The CRA will automatically determine your eligibility based on the information from your previous year's tax return.</p>

<p>If you are eligible and have filed your taxes, the CRA will issue your first payment on the payment date that comes after your 19th birthday.</p>
<p>For newcomers turing 19, refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/ccb/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/gst-hst-credit/how-get-credit.html#toc2">Apply if you are a new resident of Canada</a>.</p>
<h3>If you file your taxes after July</h3>
<p>The GST/HST credit is recalculated <strong>every</strong> July based on your tax information from the previous year. If you file your taxes after July, you must wait until the CRA has assessed your tax return to determine if you are entitled to receive the credit.</p>

<p>If any entitled credit amounts were missed, you will receive retroactive payments on the next scheduled quarterly payment date.</p>

<h2 id="toc3">Check the status of your payment</h2>
<p>If you want to receive email notifications about upcoming benefit payments, you can sign up to receive <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/payment-dates-reminder.html">benefit and credit payment reminders</a>. The reminders are sent about one week before the payment is issued.</p>

<h3>If you have not received your payment</h3>
<p>You will not receive quarterly payments if the amount per quarter is less than $50. Instead you will receive the entire amount as a single payment in July.</p>

<p>If you do not receive your GST/HST credit payment on the expected payment date, before you contact us, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check the status of your payment in your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a></li>
  <li>Make sure your personal information is up to date</li>
  <li>Check other <a href="#">reasons for stopped or changed payments</a></li>
</ul>  

<p>If you still don't know why you haven't received your payment, wait <strong>10&nbsp;business days</strong> after your expected payment date before calling us.</p>
