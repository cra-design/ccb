<p>In most cases, all you have to do to receive the GST/HST credit each year is file your taxes, even if you have no income to report.</p>
<h2>New residents of Canada must apply for the credit</h2>
<p>You <strong>do not</strong> need to do your first tax return before you can get the GST/HST credit. You can apply using one of the methods below – only one application per household is required.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a</strong> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/individuals-leaving-entering-canada-non-residents/newcomers-canada-immigrants.html">new resident</a> of Canada and have no children:</p>
<ul>
