<h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">Reasons for stopped or changed payments</h1>

<p>If your GST/HST credit payments have stopped or the amount is different from your previous quarterly payment, you can find some reasons for these changes.</p>

<h2 class="h3 mrgn-tp-md">On this page</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#toc1">Payments have stopped</a></li>
  <li><a href="#toc2">Change in payment amounts</a></li>
  <li><a href="#toc3">Personal information needs to be up to date</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc1">Payments have stopped</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You didn't file your tax return</li>
  <li>You didn't respond to a letter from the CRA about your situation</li>
  <li>You didn't inform the CRA of a change in:
    <ul>
      <li>your address</li>
      <li>your bank account</li>
    </ul>
  </li>  
  <li>You were married, divorced or had another change in your marital status</li>
  <li>Your income is now too high (recalculation happens <strong>every July</strong>, based on your income from the previous year, indexed to inflation)</li>
  <li>You stopped meeting the resident of Canada <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/gsthstc-eligibility.html">eligibility criteria</a>
  <li>You have overpayments for benefits or credits, or other tax or government debts 
</ul>
<p>If the CRA asks for additional information, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/validating-your-eligibility-benefits-credits.html">What to do if the CRA reviews your benefits</a></p>
<h3>Payment amounts used to repay a debt or overpayment</h3>
<p>If a recalculation shows you have been overpaid for the GST/HST credit, the CRA will send you a notice with a remittance voucher to inform you of the amount owing.</p>

<p>The CRA will keep all future GST/HST credit payments or tax refunds until the balance is repaid. The CRA will also apply your GST/HST credit to amounts owing for tax balances or amounts owing to other federal, provincial, or territorial government programs.</p>
<p>If you received a repayment notice, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra.html">Payments to the Canada Revenue Agency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc2">Change in payment amounts</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why your regular payment amounts for the year may have changed.</p>
<p>Your payment may have <strong>changed</strong> for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A reassessment of either your or your spouse or common-law partner's tax return results in a change to your adjusted family net income</li>
  <li>Your marital status changed</li>
  <li>The number of eligible children in your care changed</li>
  <li>You were receiving the credit for a child who has turned 19</li>
  <li>Your custody arrangement changed</li>
  <li>A recipient dies</li>
</ul>  
  
<p>The CRA will send you a GST/HST credit notice of redetermination with the revised credit amount for the year. You can view details of the recalculation in your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a>.</p>
  
<h2 id="toc3">Personal information needs to be up to date</h2>
<p>You must let the CRA know as soon as possible if there are changes to your situation or personal information. You also need to provide the date when the change happened.</p>

<p>If the CRA is unable to match or validate the information on file, your credit payments may stop temporarily. Your payments may resume after the CRA has received your updated information and recalculated your credit amount. If you are entitled to any credit amounts that were missed, those amounts will be paid as  with your next quarterly payment.</p>

<h3>Changes to your information</h3>
<p>Updating your information online is the easiest and fastest way to provide changes to the CRA. Most changes can be completed online in your CRA account. </p>

<p>Make sure your information is up to date for the following:</p>
