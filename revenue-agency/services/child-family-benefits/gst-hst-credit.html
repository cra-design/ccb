<p>The goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credit is a tax-free quarterly payment for individuals and families with low and modest incomes to help offset the GST or HST that they pay. It may also include payments from <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/provincial-territorial-programs.html">provincial&nbsp;and territorial programs</a>.</p>
          <p>You are automatically considered for the GST/HST credit when you file your taxes.</p>
