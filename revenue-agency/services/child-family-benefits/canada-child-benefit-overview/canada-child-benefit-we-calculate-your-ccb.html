<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) determines if you are entitled to CCB payments each year when you file your tax return. As family net income levels increase, the benefit amount is reduced.</p>
<p>The CCB payments are adjusted based on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number of children in your care</li>
    <li>Age of your children</li>
    <li>Your adjusted family net income (AFNI) reported in the previous year's tax return</li>
</ul>

<details>
<summary>Definition of adjusted family net income (AFNI)</summary>
<p>Your AFNI is:</p>
<ul> 
		<li>your family net income (line 23600 of your tax return, plus line 23600 of your spouse's or common-law partner's tax return, if applicable)</li>
		<li><strong>minus</strong> any Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) and registered disability savings plan (RDSP) income received (line 11700 and line 12500 of your or your spouse's tax return, if applicable)</li>
    <li><strong>plus</strong> any UCCB and RDSP amounts repaid (line 21300 and line 23200 of your or your spouse's tax return, if applicable)</li>
</ul>

                <!--<h3>How are payments calculated</h3>
                <p>Every month of the benefit year (July to June of the following year), CCB payments are adjusted based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the number of children in your care</li>
                    <li>the age of your children</li>
                    <li>your <a href="#family-net-income-definition">adjusted family net income (AFNI)</a>, as reported in last year's tax return</li>
                </ul>-->
                <h3>Current year</h3>
                <p>The following amounts are for the payment period from July 2025 to June 2026 and are based on your AFNI from 2024.</p>
                <h4>Maximum Canada child benefit</h4>
                <p>If your AFNI is under $37,487, you get the maximum amount for each child. It will not be reduced.</p>
                <p>For each child:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>under 6 years of age:</strong> $7,997 per year ($666.41 per month)</li>
                    <li><strong>6 to 17 years of age:</strong> $6,748 per year ($562.33 per month)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Examples: </strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For a child <strong>born</strong> in March 2026, you will be eligible to receive the CCB in April 2026 or the month following the month you become eligible</li>
                    <li>For a child <strong>turning 6 years of age</strong> in March 2026, you will be paid at the under 6 years of age rate for the month of March and, at the 6 to 17 years of age rate for the month of April 2026.</li>
                    <li>For a child <strong>turning 18</strong> in December 2025, the last payment will be in December 2025 at the 6 to 17 years of age rate.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Payments are based on your adjusted family net income (AFNI)</h4>
                <p>Any reduction to the maximum benefit payment depends on your AFNI and on the number of children.</p>
                <p>The payments gradually <strong>start decreasing</strong> when the adjusted family net income is over $37,487.</p>

            </details>

<h3>Estimate how much you can get</h3>

    <p>You can use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html">child and family benefits calculator</a> to find out which benefits you can get and estimate how much your payments may be.</p>
    <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html" class="btn btn-call-to-action"><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i>&nbsp; Calculate how much you can get</a>


    <h2 id="shared">Shared custody and your payments</h2>
    <p>Each parent with shared custody will get 50% of what they would have gotten if they had full custody of the child and the amount is calculated based on their own adjusted family net income.</p>
    <p>The CRA will not split the amount using other percentages, or give the full amount to one of the parents if the CRA considers you to have shared custody.</p>
    <p>If a child only lives with you <strong>part time</strong>, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-before-you-apply.html#determinecustody">Determine if you have shared custody</a> to find out if you are considered to have shared custody.</p>

    <h2 id="toc3">Payment amounts are recalculated every July</h2>
    <p>Your benefit payments are recalculated <strong>every July</strong> based on your adjusted family net income from the previous year. CCB is indexed to inflation.</p>
    <p>For example, payments from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>July 2025 to June 2026</strong>: based on your adjusted family net income from <strong>2024</strong></li>
        <li><strong>July 2024 to June 2025</strong>: based on your adjusted family net income from <strong>2023</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words, a change in your income in 2024 will only be reflected in your payments starting in July 2025.</p>
    <p>If your payment changed or stopped, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-after-you-apply.html#toc2">Reasons for stopped or changed payments</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc4">Other benefits and credits included with your CCB payment</h2>
<p>You may be eligible to receive additional benefits and credits when apply for the CCB.  The CCB may include the child disability benefit and any related provincial and territorial programs.</p>

    <h3>Related provincial and territorial benefits</h3>
    <p>The CRA also administers child and family benefit programs for certain provinces and territories who offer additional assistance to help with the cost of raising a family. Some of these benefits are combined with the CCB payment into a single monthly payment, while others are paid separately.</p>

    <p>If your child is eligible for the disability tax credit, you may also be eligible for the child disability benefit. The CRA automatically calculates your payment and adds it to your Canada child benefit payment.</p>
    <p>For the period of July 2025 to June 2026, you could get up to $3,411 ($284.25 per month) for each child who is eligible for the disability tax credit.</p>
