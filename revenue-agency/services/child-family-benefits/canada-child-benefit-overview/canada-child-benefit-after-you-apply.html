    <p>To receive your Canada Child Benefit (CCB) and related provincial and territorial payments, you must file your income tax and benefit return every year.</p> 
<p>You must also notify the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) of any changes to your situation or personal information to ensure your payments do not stop and you receive your entitled benefit amounts. </p>
    <h2 class="h3 mrgn-tp-md">On this page</h2>
    <ul>

        <li><a href="#toc2">Reasons for stopped or changed payments</a></li>
        <li><a href="#toc3">Keep your CRA information up to date</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="toc1">File your tax return to keep getting your payments</h2>
<p>Once you've applied for the CCB, you must file your tax return <strong>every year</strong> to continue receiving the benefit and related provincial and territorial payments. If you have a spouse or common-law partner, they must also file their tax return on time every year.</p>

<p>You must file your tax return, even if your income is tax exempt or you have no income. Your payments will stop if you don't do your taxes. </p>

<p>If you have a modest income and a simple tax situation, a volunteer may be able to do your taxes for you at a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/free-tax-help.html">free tax clinic</a>.</p>

<h3>If you file your taxes late</h3>
<p>You must file your tax return by <strong>April 30 each year</strong> to ensure there is no disruption to your monthly benefit payments. Your benefit is recalculated every July. The recalculation is based on your adjusted family net income from the previous year.</p>

<p>If you file your taxes late, your benefit payments may stop temporarily. Your payments will resume after your tax return is assessed. Any entitled benefit amounts that were missed will be paid as a lump sum with your next scheduled payment.</p>


    <h2 id="toc2">Reasons for stopped or changed payments</h2>
    <p>Find out why your payment may have stopped or changed.</p>

<h3>Payments have stopped</h3> 
                <p>Your payment may have <strong>stopped</strong> because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>you didn't <a href="#tax">file your tax return</a></li>
                    <li>you didn't respond to a letter from the CRA about your situation</li>
                    <li>
                        you didn't inform the CRA of a change in:
                        <ul>
                            <li>your address</li>
                            <li>your bank account</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>you were married, divorced or had another change in your marital status</li>
                    <li>your income is now too high (recalculation happens <strong>every July</strong>, based on your income from the previous year, indexed to inflation)</li>
                    <li>your child turned 18</li>
                    <li>you no longer have a child in your care</li>
                    <li>you stopped meeting any of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-before-you-apply.html#who">eligibility criteria</a>, including residency and citizenship requirements</li>
                    <li>You, your spouse or common-law partner are missing a statement of world income</li>
                </ul>


<h4>Resuming your payments</h4>
<p>If you are still eligible for the benefit and your payments have stopped due to outdated or missing information, the CRA will resume your benefit payments <strong>after</strong> you've provided or updated your information. </p>
<p>Your payments may be adjusted and any entitled benefit amounts that were missed will be paid as a lump sum with your next scheduled payment.</p>
<p>If your situation or personal information needs to be updated, make sure to <a href="#toc3">notify the CRA about changes</a>.</p>



<h3>Change in payment amounts</h3>
<p>There are several reasons why your regular payment amounts may have changed.</p>

    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li>
            <details>
                <summary>Changes to income, custody or marital status, or eligible children</summary>
                <p>Your payment may have <strong>changed</strong> for the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your family net income changed (we recalculate payments <strong>every July</strong>, based on income from the previous year, indexed to inflation)</li>
                    <li>Your marital status changed</li>
                    <li>The number of children in your care changed</li>
                    <li>Your child turned 6</li>
                    <li>One of your children turned 18</li>
                    <li>One of your children is no longer in your care</li>
                    <li>Your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-before-you-apply.html#shared">custody arrangement</a> changed</li>
                </ul>
                <p> To view details of any changes to your calculation, check your benefit notice in your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA account</a>.</p>
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>
            <details>
                <summary>Payment amounts used to repay an overpayment</summary>
                <p id="repayments">If a recalculation shows that we paid you too much CCB, the CRA will send you a notice with a remittance voucher attached to inform you of the balance owing.</p>
                <p>The CRA may keep all or a portion of future CCB payments, income tax refunds, or goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credits until your balance owing is repaid. This may also apply to other federal, provincial, and territorial programs that the CRA administers.</p>
                <p>If you received a repayment notice, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments/payments-cra.html">Payments to the Canada Revenue Agency</a>.</p>
            </details>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="toc3">Keep your CRA information up to date</h2>
    <p>If your situation or personal information changes, you must let the CRA know as soon as possible. If the CRA is unable to match or validate the information on file, your benefit payments may stop temporarily until your information is updated.</p>

<p>Updating your information online is the easiest and fastest way to provide changes to the CRA. Most changes can be completed online in your CRA account.</p>

<p>Your payments will resume after the CRA has received your updated information. Any entitled benefit amounts that were missed will be paid as a lump sum with your next scheduled payment.</p>

                <h4>The Canada child benefit recipient has died</h4>
                <p>If the benefit recipient has died, the next of kin or the estate must tell the CRA as soon as possible. Someone else may be eligible to get the benefits for the child.</p>
                <p>If you are the surviving spouse or common-law partner of the former recipient, in most cases you won't have to fill out a new CCB application. The child will be transferred automatically to your account.</p>
                <p>We may still send a payment after the date of death if we are not aware of the death. If this happens, return the payment to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/address-tax-centre-mail-your-forms.html">tax centre</a> with a brief letter of explanation.</p>
                <h4>You are the benefit recipient and your spouse or common-law partner has died</h4>
                <p>If you receive benefit payments for a child and your spouse or common-law partner has died, contact us to tell us his or her date of death. We will recalculate your payments to adjust your revised family net income.</p>
                <h4>You are the new primary caregiver</h4>
                <p>If anyone other than the parent is now primarily responsible for the child (such as a grandparent or guardian), that person will have to apply for benefit payments for the child in one of these ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use "Apply for child benefits" in your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">CRA account</a></li>

                                <li>Use "Modify shared custody" in your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">CRA account</a>,</li>

                <summary>Temporary custody change</summary>
                <p>Changes in custody can sometimes be temporary. This can happen, for example, if the child usually lives with one individual, but goes to live with another individual for the summer.</p>
                <p>In these cases, the individual that gets custody on a temporary basis can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview/canada-child-benefit-apply.html#wb-cont-nav.html%23apply">apply to get payments</a> for that period. When the child returns to live with the other individual, they need to re-apply to start getting the payments again.</p>

                <summary>Child is no longer in your care</summary>
                <p>You must tell the CRA right away if you are getting benefit or credit payments for a child who is no longer in your care, stops living with you, or dies. This will avoid overpayments and requests to pay back some of your benefits.</p>
                <p>Your entitlement to benefit payments stops the month after the child is no longer in your care.</p>
                <p>If you are receiving the GST/HST credit for a child who moves out, becomes a spouse or common-law partner <strong>or</strong> a parent, you must also let us know.</p>
                <p>You can let the CRA know in one of the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>use "End care of child" in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">your CRA account</a></li>

                <summary>Child has died</summary>
                <p>If an eligible child has died, you must tell the CRA as soon as possible. If you were the eligible CCB recipient for a child who passed away on or after <span class="nowrap">January 1, 2025</span>, you may remain eligible to receive CCB payments for 6 additional months, or until the date the child would have turned&nbsp;18. The additional 6&nbsp;months also applies to the Child Disability Benefit (CDB), as well as some provincial and territorial programs.</p>
