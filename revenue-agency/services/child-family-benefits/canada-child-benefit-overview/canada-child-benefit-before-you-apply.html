    <h2 id="toc2">Who should apply when both parents live together</h2>

    <p>When 2 individuals who are spouses or common-law partners reside in the same home as the child, the <strong>female parent</strong> is presumed to be primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of all the children in the home. She should be the one applying for the CCB. The female presumption is a legislative requirement and only one payment per household can be issued under the Income Tax Act. No matter which parent receives the CCB, the amount will be the same.</p>
    <p>However, if the <strong>other parent</strong> is primarily responsible, they should apply and attach a signed letter from the female parent stating that they are primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of all the children in the home.</p>
    <p>If the child resides with same-sex parents, only one parent should apply for all the children in the home.</p>
