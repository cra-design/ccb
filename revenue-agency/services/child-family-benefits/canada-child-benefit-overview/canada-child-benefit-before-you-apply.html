    <p>When 2 individuals who are spouses or common-law partners reside in the same home as the child, the <strong>female parent</strong> is presumed to be primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of all the children in the home. She should be the one applying for the CCB. The female presumption is a legislative requirement and only one payment per household can be issued under the Income Tax Act. No matter which parent receives the CCB, the amount will be the same.</p>
    <p>However, if the <strong>other parent</strong> is primarily responsible, they should apply and attach a signed letter from the female parent stating that they are primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of all the children in the home.</p>
    <p>If the child resides with same-sex parents, only one parent should apply for all the children in the home.</p>

    <h2 id="toc3">Who should apply in a custody arrangement</h2>
    <p>If a child only lives with you part of the time, you need to determine if you are considered to have shared custody.</p>
    <p>You must notify the CRA if your shared custody situation changes.</p>

                <p id="change">Changes in custody can sometimes be temporary. This can happen, for example, if the child usually lives with one individual, but goes to live with another individual for the summer.</p>
                <p>In these cases, the individual that gets custody on a temporary basis can apply to get CCB payments for that period. When the child returns to live with the other individual, they need to reapply to start getting the payments again.</p>
                <p><strong>Who should apply:</strong> You can only apply for the period when the child is living with you.</p>
