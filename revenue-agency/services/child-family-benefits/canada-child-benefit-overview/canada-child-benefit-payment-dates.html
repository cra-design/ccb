<h2 id="toc2">Check the status of your payments</h2>

<p>If you want to receive email notifications about upcoming benefit payments, you can sign up to receive <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/payment-dates-reminder.html">benefit and credit payment reminders</a>. The reminders are sent about one week before the payment is issued.</p>
<h3>If you have a CRA account</h3>
<p>You can sign in to your CRA account to view:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your next expected payment date and amount</li>
    <li>The status and amount of each payment for the benefit year, from July to the following June</li>
    <li>Your statement of account for the CCB, including details about amounts and entitlements, dates, and balances</li>
</ul>

</ol>    


<h3>If you have not received your payment</h3>

<p>You will not receive a monthly payment if your total benefit amount for the year is less than $240. Instead you will receive one lump sum payment with your July payment.</p>
<p>If you don't receive your CCB payment on the expected payment date, you can sign in to your CRA account to check the status of your payment.</p>
<p>If you do not have access to your CRA account, wait <strong>5 business days</strong> after your expected payment date before you contact us.</p>



<h2 id="toc3">When to expect your first payment</h2>
<p>You will receive your first CCB payment after the CRA has determined your eligibility and processed your application. </p>
<p>There are 2 ways you can check how long this may take.</p>
<h3>Check the status of your application in your CRA account</h3> 
<p>You may be able to check the status of your application using the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/progress-tracker.html">progress tracker</a> when you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">sign in to you CRA account</a>.</p>
<h3>Check general wait times for CCB applications</h3>
<p>Processing times for your CCB application will vary based on how you applied.</p>
