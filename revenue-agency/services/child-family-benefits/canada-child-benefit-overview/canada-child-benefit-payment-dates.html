<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) sends monthly payments for the Canada Child Benefit (CCB).</p>

    <h2 class="h3 mrgn-tp-md">On this page</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#toc1">Canada child benefit payment dates</a></li>
        <li><a href="#toc2">First payment</a></li>
        <li><a href="#toc3">Payments stopped or changed</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="toc1">Payment dates for the CCB</h2>
    <p>You should receive your CCB payments by the middle of each month. The CRA makes CCB payments on the following dates:</p>

<h3><span class="far fa-calendar-alt fa-li"></span> 2025 payment dates</h3>
    <section data-ajax-replace="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/calendar.html#ccb-2025"></section>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit/individuals.html">sign up for direct deposit</a> if you do not already have it set up with the CRA. Direct deposit is the fastest and most secure way to get your benefit payments.</p>

    <section data-ajax-replace="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/calendar.html#ccb-2024"></section>

<h2 id="toc2">Check the status of your payments</h2>

<p>If you want to receive email notifications about upcoming benefit payments, you can sign up to receive <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/payment-dates-reminder.html">benefit and credit payment reminders</a>. The reminders are sent about one week before the payment is issued.</p>

<p>If you have a CRA account, you can view:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your next expected payment date and amount</li>
    <li>The status and amount of each payment for the year, from July to the following June</li>
    <li>Your statement of account for the CCB, including details about amounts and entitlements, dates, and balances</li>
</ul>

    <li>Select Benefits and credits to find detailed payment information</li>
    <li>Go to Canada Child Benefit (CCB) to find your next expected payment date and amount, payment schedule, and your statement of account</li>

      </li>
</ul>

<h3>If you have not received your payment</h3>

<p>You will not receive a monthly payment if your total benefit amount for the year is less than $240. Instead you will receive one lump sum payment with your July payment.</p>
<p>If you don't receive your CCB payment on the expected payment date, you can sign in to your CRA account to check the status of your payment.</p>
<p>If you do not have access to your CRA account, wait <strong>5 business days</strong> after your expected payment date before you contact us.</p>



<h2 id="toc3">When to expect your first payment</h2>
<p>You will receive your first CCB payment after the CRA has determined your eligibility and processed your application. </p>
<p>There are 2 ways you can check how long this may take.</p>
<h3>Check the status of your application in your CRA account <h3> 
<p>You may be able to check the status of your application using the <a href="https://canada-preview.adobecqms.net/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/progress-tracker.html">progress tracker</a> when you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">sign in to you CRA account</a>.</p>
<h3>Check general wait times for CCB applications<h3>
<p>Processing times for your CCB application will vary based on how you applied.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Choose the option you used to apply</li>
    <li>Select the <strong>Show targeted processing times</strong> button to find the current processing time</li>
