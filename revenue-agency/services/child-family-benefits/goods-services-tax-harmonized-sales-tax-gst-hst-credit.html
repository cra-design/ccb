<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credit is a tax-free quarterly payment that helps individuals and families with low and modest incomes offset the GST or HST that they pay. It may also include payments from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/provincial-territorial-programs.html">provincial&nbsp;and territorial programs</a>. You are automatically considered for the GST/HST credit when you file your taxes.</p>
