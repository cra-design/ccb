<h2>Eligibility<span class="nowrap"></span></h2>

            <li class="cnjnctn-col">
                <p>At the <strong>beginning</strong> of the month the CRA makes a payment</p>

<details>
    <summary>Example – Eligibility period as a new resident</summary>
    <p>Marceline turned 19 years old in September and became a resident that month. She applied for the GST/HST credit when she arrived to Canada. Now in October, Marceline wants to know if she is eligible to get a payment for the month.</p>
    <p>Because Marceline turned 19 in September and was a resident in that month, if she is still a Canadian resident at the beginning of October, she will be eligible to receive a payment for the month.</p>

<p>If, however, a child welfare agency is legally, physically, or financially responsible for a child, you are not generally eligible for the GST/HST credit for that child.</p>
