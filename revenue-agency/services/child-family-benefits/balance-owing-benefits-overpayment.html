<h2>What to do if you have a balance owing for your child and family benefits</h2>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may apply all income tax refunds, or goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credits or&nbsp;Canada Carbon Rebate (CCR) (formerly known as Climate action incentive payment) to your balance owing (debt) <strong>until your debt is resolved</strong>.</p>
<p>This may also apply to other federal, provincial, and territorial benefit and credit programs that the CRA administers.</p>
<p>Once your debt has been resolved, you will again receive the full amount of benefit and credit payments you are entitled to.</p>
